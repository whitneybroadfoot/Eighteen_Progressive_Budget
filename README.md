# User Experience
As an avid traveler, I want to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection so that my account balance is accurate when I am traveling abroad.

# Business Context
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to the applications success.
